This is a junior barbarian. He--or is it she? You can't tell for sure--
looks like... it should still be in barbarian school. The barbarians are
putting them in the dungeons young these days. It's wearing dirty, tattered
cloth armor and wielding a wooden sword. You have a hard time feeling
intimidated.
